/*main(args) method is invoked recursively without specifying any exit condition,
so this code ultimately throws java.lang.StackOverflowError.
StackOverflowError is a subclass of Error type and not Exception type, hence it is not handled.
 Stack trace is printed to the console and program ends abruptly.

Java doesn't allow to catch specific checked exceptions if these are not thrown by the statements inside try block.

catch(java.io.FileNotFoundException ex) {} will cause compilation error in this case as main(args);
will never throw FileNotFoundException. But Java allows to catch Exception type,
hence catch (Exception ex) {} doesn't cause any compilation error.*/
