//If a method declares to throw Exception or its sub-type other than
// RuntimeException types, then calling method should follow handle or declare rule.
// In this case, as method m1() declares to throw Exception,
// so main method should either declare the same exception or
// its super type in its throws clause OR m1(); should be surrounded by try-catch block.

//
//Line 3 in this case causes compilation error.
