//First add parenthesis (round brackets) to the given expression: -a++.
//
//There are 2 operators involved. unary minus and Postfix operator. Let's start with expression and value of a.
//
//
//
//-a++; [a = 100].
//
//-(a++); [a = 100] Postfix operator has got higher precedence than unary operator.
//
//-(100); [a = 101] Use the value of a (100) in the expression and after that increase the value of a to 101.
//
//-100; [a = 101] -100 is printed on to the console.
