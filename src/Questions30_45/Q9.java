//As do-while loop executes at least once, hence none of the code is unreachable in this case.
//
//Java runtime prints 100 to the console, then it checks boolean expression, which is false.
//
//Hence control goes out of do-while block.
// Java runtime executes 2nd System.out.println statement to print "Bye" on to the console.
