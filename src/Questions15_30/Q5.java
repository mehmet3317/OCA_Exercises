/*Before you answer this, you must know that there are 5 different Student object created in the memory
 (4 at the time of adding to the list and 1 at the time of removing from the list).
  This means these 5 Student objects will be stored at different memory addresses.

remove(Object) method removes the first occurrence of matching object and equals(Object) method decides
whether 2 objects are equal or not. equals(Object) method defined in Object class uses == operator to check
the equality and in this case as 5 Student objects are stored at different memory location, hence not equal.

Nothing is removed from the students list, all the 4 Student objects are printed in the insertion order.*/
