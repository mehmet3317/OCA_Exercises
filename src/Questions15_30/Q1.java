public class Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java");
        String s1 = sb.toString();
        String s2 = sb.toString();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}

/*Explanation
toString() method defined in StringBuilder class doesn't use String literal rather
 uses the constructor of String class to create the instance of String class.



So both s1 and s2 refer to different String instances even though their contents are same. s1 == s2 returns false.*/
