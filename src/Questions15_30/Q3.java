    }
}
/*`new StringBuilder(100);` creates a StringBuilder instance,
 whose internal char array's length is 100 but length() method of StringBuilder object returns the number of characters stored in
  the internal array and in this case it is 0. So, `sb.length()` returns 0.

sb.toString() is the String representation of StringBuilder instance and
 in this case as there are no characters inside the StringBuilder object, hence sb.toString() returns
 an empty String "", so `sb.toString().length()` also returns 0.

Output is 0:0.*/
