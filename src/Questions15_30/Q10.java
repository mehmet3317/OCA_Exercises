//HINT: First check if members are accessible or not. All the codes are in same file Test.java
// , and Point class & variable x, y are declared with default modifier hence these can be accessed within the same package.
// Class Test belongs to same package so no issues in accessing Point class and instance variables of Point class.
// Make use of pen and paper to draw the memory diagrams (heap and stack). It will be pretty quick to reach the result.
//
//
//
//        Point p1 = new Point(); means p1.x = 0 and p1.y = 0 as instance variable are initialized to respective zeros.
//
//        p1.x = 10; means replace 0 with 10 in p1.x,
//
//        p1.y = 20; means replace 0 with 20 in p1.y,
//
//
//
//        Point p2 = new Point(); means p2.x = 0 and p2.y = 0 as instance variable are initialized to respective zeros.
//
//        p2.assign(p1.x, p1.y); invokes the assign method, parameter variable x = 10 and y = 20.
//
//        As assign is invoked on p2 reference variable hence this and p2 refers to same Point object.
//
//        x = this.x; means assign 0 to parameter variable x, no changes in this.y, which means p2.x is unchanged.
//
//        this.y = y; means assign 20 to this.y, which means p2.y is now 20
//
//        So after assign method is invoked and control goes back to main method: p1.x = 10, p1.y = 20, p2.x = 0 and p2.y = 20.
//
//        Output is: Point(10, 20);Point(0, 20)
